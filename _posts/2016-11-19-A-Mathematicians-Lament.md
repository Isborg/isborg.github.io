title: A Mathematician's Lament
---

I first encountered *A Mathematician's Lament* in its original essay form on April 2014. This is a passionate rant about the teaching of mathematics and how we've clearly been doing it wrong. The essay was written in 2002 by Paul Lockhart, passed around, and eventually widely spread by mathematician Keith Devlin in his [online column](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_03_08.html) on the Mathematical Association of America's web-zine on March 2008.

The essay has inspired both possitive and negative responses regarding how math education is and should be conducted. Personally, I disagree with the foundation of modern (not really modern) formal education principles and ideas in general, not just in mathematics, and agree with most of Lockhart's arguments. This year I read his essay again and decided to buy the extended book version, published in 2009, which drove me to write this post.

This will mainly contain excerpts from the original text, so it should be a decent Sunday read, but I encourage you to read the real thing. If you want the full experience, [buy the book](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematicians-Lament-School-Fascinating-Imaginative/dp/1934137170). If you don't feel like spending any money or just don't care too much, try reading [the original 25-page essay](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf). If you're just bored or in transit, then fine, read this post instead, hopefully by the end you'll want to read more Lockhart (Paul, not Gilderoy).

> If I'm in the mood to think about shapes - and I often am - I might imagine a triangle inside a rectangular box.

> If I chop the rectangle into two pieces like this, I can see that each piece is cut diagonally in half by the sides of the triangle. So there is just as much space inside the triangle as outside. That means that the triangle must take up exactly half the box!

> This is why it is so heartbreaking to see what is being done to mathematics in school. This rich and fascinating adventure of the imagination has been reduced to a sterile set of facts to be memorized and procedures to be followed. In place of a simple and natural question about shapes, and a creative and rewarding process of invention and discovery, students are treated to this.
