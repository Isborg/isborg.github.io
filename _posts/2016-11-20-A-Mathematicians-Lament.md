title: A Mathematician's Lament
---

I first encountered *A Mathematician's Lament* in its original essay form on April 2014. This is a passionate rant about the teaching of mathematics and how we've clearly been doing it wrong. The essay was written in 2002 by Paul Lockhart, passed around, and eventually widely spread by mathematician Keith Devlin in his [online column](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_03_08.html) on the Mathematical Association of America's web-zine on March 2008.

The essay has inspired both possitive and negative responses regarding how math education is and should be conducted. Personally, I disagree with the foundation of modern (not really modern) formal education principles and ideas in general, not just in mathematics, and agree with most of Lockhart's arguments. This year I read his essay again and decided to buy the extended book version, published in 2009, which drove me to write this post.

This will mainly contain excerpts from the original text, so it should be a decent Sunday read, but I encourage you to read the real thing. If you want the full experience, [buy the book](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematicians-Lament-School-Fascinating-Imaginative/dp/1934137170). If you don't feel like spending any money or just don't care too much, try reading [the original 25-page essay](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf). If you're just bored or in transit, then fine, read this post instead, hopefully by the end you'll want to read more Lockhart (Paul, not Gilderoy).

> The only people who understand what is going on are the ones most often blamed and least often heard: the students. They say, "Math class is stupid and boring," and they are right.

<br/><br/>

> If I'm in the mood to think about shapes - and I often am - I might imagine a triangle inside a rectangular box.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://isbaum.com/images/AMathematiciansLament/1.jpg" /></div>

> If I chop the rectangle into two pieces like this, I can see that each piece is cut diagonally in half by the sides of the triangle. So there is just as much space inside the triangle as outside. That means that the triangle must take up exactly half the box!

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://isbaum.com/images/AMathematiciansLament/2.jpg" /></div>

> This is why it is so heartbreaking to see what is being done to mathematics in school. This rich and fascinating adventure of the imagination has been reduced to a sterile set of facts to be memorized and procedures to be followed. In place of a simple and natural question about shapes, and a creative and rewarding process of invention and discovery, students are treated to this.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://isbaum.com/images/AMathematiciansLament/3.jpg" /></div>

> Obviously the current practical training program isn’t working, and for good reason: it is excruciatingly boring, and nobody ever uses it anyway. So why do people think it’s so important? I don’t see how it’s doing society any good to have its members walking around with vague memories of algebraic formulas and geometric diagrams, and clear memories of hating them.

<br/><br/>

> All this fussing and primping about which "topics" should be taught in what order, or the use of this notation instead of that notation, or which make and model of calculator to use, for god’s sake - it’s like rearranging the deck chairs on the *Titanic*!

<br/><br/>

> The saddest part of all this "reform" are the attempts to "make math interesting" and "relevant to kids' lives." You don’t need to *make* math interesting - it’s already more interesting than we can handle! And the glory of it is its complete *irrelevance* to our lives. That’s why it’s so fun!
<br/>
> Attempts to present mathematics as relevant to daily life inevitably appear forced and contrived: "You see kids, if you know algebra then you can figure out how old Maria is if we know that she is two years older than twice her age seven years ago!" (As if anyone would ever have access to that ridiculous kind of information, and not her age.) Algebra is not about daily life, it's about numbers and symmetry - and this is a valid pursuit in and of itself:
<br/>
> Suppose I am given the sum and difference of two numbers. How can I figure out what the numbers are themselves?
<br/>
> Here is a simple and elegant question, and it requires no effort to be made appealing. The ancient Babylonians enjoyed working on such problems, and so do our students. (And I hope you will enjoy thinking about it too!) We don’t need to bend over backwards to give mathematics relevance. It has relevance in the same way that any art does: that of being a meaningful human experience.

<br/><br/>

> Which is more interesting - measuring the rough dimensions of a circular piece of graph paper, using a formula that someone handed you without explanation (and made you memorize and practice over and over) or hearing the story of one of the most beautiful, fascinating problems, and one of the most brilliant and powerful ideas in human history? We’re killing people’s interest in *circles* for god’s sake!

<br/><br/>

> **STUDENT:** I was thinking about our triangle problem, and I noticed something. If the triangle is really slanted then it *doesn't* take up half its box! See, look.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://isbaum.com/images/AMathematiciansLament/4.jpg" /></div>

> **TEACHER:** Excellent observation! Our chopping argument assumes that the tip of the triangle lies directly over the base. Now we need a new idea.
<br/>
> **STUDENT:** Should I try chopping it a different way?
<br/>
> **TEACHER:** Absolutely. Try all sorts of ideas. Let me know what you come up with!
<br/>
> So how do we teach our students to do mathematics? By choosing engaging and natural problems suitable to their tastes, personalities, and level of experience. By giving them time to make discoveries and formulate conjectures. By helping them to refine their arguments and creating an atmosphere of healthy and vibrant mathematical criticism. By being flexible and open to sudden changes in direction to which their curiosity may lead. In short, by having an honest intellectual relationship with our students and our subject.
<br/>
> Of course what I'm suggesting is impossible for a number of reasons. Even putting aside the fact that statewide curricula and standardized tests virtually eliminate teacher autonomy, I doubt that most teachers even want to have such an intense relationship with their students. It requires too much vulnerability and too much responsibility - in short, it's too much work!
<br/>
> It is far easier to be a passive conduit of some publisher's "materials" and to follow the shampoo-bottle instruction "lecture, test, repeat" than to think deeply and thoughtfully about the meaning of one's subject and how best to convey that meaning directly and honestly to one's students.

<br/><br/>

> In place of discovery and exploration, we have rules and regulations. We never hear a student saying, "I wanted to see if it could make any sense to raise a number to a negative power, and I found that you get a really neat pattern if you choose it to mean the reciprocal." Instead we have teachers and textbooks presenting the "negative exponent rule" as a fait accompli with no mention of the aesthetics behind this choice, or even that it is a choice.

<br/><br/>

> The curriculum is obsessed with jargon and nomenclature, seemingly for no other purpose than to provide teachers with something to test the students on. No mathematician in the world would bother making these senseless distinctions: 2 1/2 is a "mixed number," while 5/2 is an "improper fraction." They're *equal* for crying out loud. They are the same exact numbers, and have the same exact properties. Who uses such words outside of fourth grade?

<br/><br/>

> Even if we agree that a basic common vocabulary for mathematics is valuable, this isn't it. How sad that fifth-graders are taught to say "quadrilateral" instead of "four-sided shape," but are never given a reason to use words like "conjecture," and "counterexample." High school students must learn to use the secant function, 'sec x,' as an abbreviation for the reciprocal of the cosine function, '1 / cos x,' a definition with as much intellectual weight as the decision to use '&' in place of "and." That this particular shorthand, a holdover from fifteenth century nautical tables, is still with us (whereas others, such as the "versine" have died out) is mere historical accident, and is of utterly no value in an era when rapid and precise shipboard computation is no longer an issue. Thus we clutter our math classes with pointless nomenclature for its own sake.
<br/>
> In practice, the curriculum is not even so much a sequence of topics, or ideas, as it is a sequence of notations. Apparently mathematics consists of a secret list of mystical symbols and rules for their manipulation. Young children are given '+' and '÷.' Only later can they be entrusted with '√,' and then 'x' and 'y' and the alchemy of parentheses. Finally, they are indoctrinated in the use of 'sin,' 'log,' 'f(x),' and if they are deemed worthy, 'd' and '∫.' All without having had a single meaningful mathematical experience.

<br/><br/>

> Does any middle school algebra teacher have the slightest clue why he is asking his students to repgrase "the number *x* lies between three and seven" as &#124;x - 5&#124; < 2? Do these hopelessly inept textbook authors really believe they are helping students by preparing them for a possible day, years hence, when they might be operating within the context of a higher-dimensional geometry or an abstract metric space? I doubt it. I expect they are simply copying each other decade after decade, maybe changing the fonts or the highlight colors, and beaming with pride when a school system adops their book and becomes their unwitting accomplice.

<br/><br/>

> **SIMPLICIO:** I'm getting tired of all your mystical mumbo-jumbo! Basic arithmetic, all right? Do you or do you not agree that students should learn it?
<br/>
> **SALVIATI:** That depends on what you mean by "it." If you mean having an appreciation for the problems of counting and arranging, the advantages of grouping and naming, the distinction between a representation and the thing itself, and some idea of the historical development of number systems, then yes, I do think our students should be exposed to such things. If you mean the rote memorization of arithmetic facts without any underlying conceptual framework, then no. If you mean exploring the not-at-all obvious fact that five groups of seven is the same as seven groups of five, then yes. If you mean making a rule that 5 × 7 = 7 × 5, then no. Doing mathematics should always mean discovering patterns and crafting beautiful and meaningful explanations.

<br/><br/>

> A proof, that is, a mathematical argument, is a work of fiction, a poem. Its goal is to *satisfy*. A beautiful proof should explain, and it should explain clearly, deeply, and elegantly. A well-written, well-crafted argument should feel like a splash of cool water, and be a beacon of light - it should refresh the spirit and illuminate the mind. And it should be *charming*.
<br/>
> There is nothing charming about what passes for proof in geometry class. Students are presented a rigid and dogmatic format in which their so-called "proofs" are to be conducted - a format as unnecessary and inappropriate as insisting that children who wish to plant a garden refer to their flowers by genus and species.
<br/>
> Let's look at some specific instances of this insanity. We'll begin with the example of two crossed lines.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://isbaum.com/images/AMathematiciansLament/5.jpg" /></div>

> Now the first thing that usually happens is the unnecessary muddying of the waters with excessive notation. Apparently, one cannot simply speak of two crossed lines; one must give elaborate names to them. And not simple names like 'line 1' and 'line 2,' or even 'a' and 'b.' We must (according to high school geometry) select random and irrelevant points on these lines, and then refer to the lines using the special "line notation."

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://isbaum.com/images/AMathematiciansLament/6.jpg" /></div>

> You see, now we get to call them *AB* and *CD*. And god forbid you should omit the little bars on top - 'AB' refers to the *length* of the line *AB* (at least I think that's how it works). Never mind how pointlessly complicated it is, this is the way one must learn to do it. Now comes the actual statement, usually referred to by some absurd name like:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://isbaum.com/images/AMathematiciansLament/7.jpg" /></div>

> In other words, the angles on both sides are the same. Well, duh! The configuration of two crossed lines is *symmetrical* for crissake. And as if this weren't bad enough, this patently obvious statement about lines and angles must then be "proved."

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://isbaum.com/images/AMathematiciansLament/8.jpg" /></div>

> Instead of a witty and enjoyable argument written by an actual human being, and conducted in one of the world's many natural languages, we get this sullen, soulless, bureaucratic form-letter of a proof. And what a mountain being made of a molehill! Do we really want to suggest that a straightforward observation like this requires such an extensive preamble? Be honest: did you actually even read it? Of course not. Who would want to?

<br/><br/>

> As a more serious example, let's take the case of a triangle inside a semicircle.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://isbaum.com/images/AMathematiciansLament/9.jpg" /></div>

> Now the beautiful truth about this pattern is that no matter where on the circle you place the tip of the triangle, it always forms a nice right angle. (I have no objection to a term like "right angle" if it is relevant to the problem and makes it easier to discuss. It's not terminology itself that I object to, it's pointless, unnecessary terminology. In any case, I would be happy to use "corner" or even "pigpen" if a student preferred.)

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://isbaum.com/images/AMathematiciansLament/10.jpg" /></div>

> Here is a case where our intuition is somewhat in doubt. It's not at all clear that this should be true; it even seems *unlikely* - shouldn't the angle change if I move the tip? What we have here is a fantastic math problem! Is it true? If so, *why* is it true? What a great project! What a terrific opportunity to excercise one's ingenuity and imagination! Of course no such opportunity is given to the students, whose curiosity and interest is immediately deflated by:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://isbaum.com/images/AMathematiciansLament/11.jpg" /></div>

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://isbaum.com/images/AMathematiciansLament/12.jpg" /></div>

> Could anything be more unattractive and inelegant? Could any argument be more obfuscatory and unreadable? This isn't mathematics! A proof should be an epiphany from the gods, not a coded message from the Pentagon. This is what comes from a misplaced sense of logical rigor: *ugliness*. The spirit of the argument has been burried under a heap of confusing formalism.
<br/>
> No mathematician works this way. No mathematician has *ever* worked this way. This is a complete and utter misunderstanding of the mathematical enterprise. Mathematics is not about erecting barriers between ourselves and our intuition, and making simple things complicated. Mathematics is about removing obstacles to our intuition, and keeping simple things simple.
<br/>
> Compare this unappetizing mess of a proof with the following argument devised by one of my seventh-graders:
> Take the triangle and rotate it around so it makes a four-sided box inside the circle. Since the triangle got turned completely around, the sides of the box must be parallel, so it makes a parallelogram. But it can't be a slanted box because both of its diagonals are diameters of the circle, so they're equal. which means it must be an actual rectangle. That's why the corner is always a right angle.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://isbaum.com/images/AMathematiciansLament/13.jpg" /></div>

> **SIMPLICIO:** All right, I'm thoroughly depressed. What now?
<br/>
> **SALVIATI:** Well, I think I have an idea about a pyramid inside a cube...
